# CLAUDE.md — PolyKybdHost

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working in the **PolyKybdHost** repo (the Python host software).

For cross-repo context (how this repo relates to `qmk_firmware/` and `AdafruitGFX/`), see [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).

## Commands

### Run the application
```bash
python -m polyhost                        # standard
python -m polyhost --debug 1              # basic debug logging
python -m polyhost --debug 2              # verbose debug logging
python -m polyhost --host <IP>            # forward to remote host
python -m polyhost --portable             # no autostart registration
```

### Run tests
```bash
# Use the project venv — system python3 is missing numpy and other deps
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -v -s ./tests -p "*_test.py"   # all tests
.venv/bin/python -m unittest tests.device.cmd_composer_test           # single module
```

### Install
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Operating modes

**Normal mode** (default): PolyKybdHost runs on the machine the keyboard is physically connected to. It owns the HID device, tracks the active window, and pushes overlay/icon/keymap updates directly to the keyboard.

**Forwarder mode** (`--host <IP>` or `--host-file <file>`): runs on a *remote* machine that has no keyboard attached. `PolyForwarder` watches the active window on that machine and relays the window title/app info over TCP to the Normal-mode instance on the keyboard machine. This lets a single keyboard serve multiple computers — the keyboard always reflects what's focused on whichever machine the user is currently working on.

## Architecture

**PolyKybdHost** is a PyQt5 system-tray application that bridges the PolyKybd HID keyboard device to the host OS. It tracks the active window and sends overlay/keymap/language commands to the device over HID.

### Entry & top-level classes
- `polyhost/__main__.py` → `polyhost/main_app.py` — CLI parsing, selects which class to start
- `polyhost/host.py` — `PolyHost(QApplication)`: Normal mode; owns device, tray icon, device loop, GUI dialogs
- `polyhost/forwarder.py` — `PolyForwarder`: Forwarder mode; no device access, only TCP window reporting

### Device communication (`polyhost/device/`)
- `poly_kybd.py` — `PolyKybd`: primary device interface; HID communication, command dispatch, state management. Uses 64-byte HID reports (protocol v0.7.0+).
- `hid_helper.py` — device enumeration/access via `hid` (hidapi)
- `cmd_composer.py` / `command_ids.py` — command building and HID ID enums
- `bit_packing.py` — binary packing helpers for HID payloads
- `poly_kybd_mock.py` — drop-in mock device for running without hardware

### Platform input abstraction (`polyhost/input/`)
Abstract base `unicode_input.py` with per-platform implementations:
- `win_helper.py` — Windows (pynput)
- `macos_helper.py` — macOS (pynput)
- `linux_gnome_helper.py` — GNOME/X11 (pynput + X11)
- `linux_kde_helper.py` — KDE Plasma (D-Bus)

### Window/overlay handler (`polyhost/handler/`)
- `active_window.py` — `OverlayHandler`: active-window tracking, triggers keymap/language/overlay switches on the device based on which app is focused
- `remote_window.py` — TCP-based window title relay for multi-machine setups
- `kde_win_reporter.py` — KDE D-Bus integration for window events

### GUI (`polyhost/gui/`)
PyQt5 widgets: main window (`host.py`), settings dialog, command menu, log viewer, layout editor (`layout_dialog/`), tray icon state manager.

### Configuration (`polyhost/settings.py`)
YAML config persisted to XDG config dir via `platformdirs`. Covers unicode composition mode, brightness/daylight settings (solar calculations via `pvlib`/`geocoder`), HID rate limits, and debug flags.

### Services (`polyhost/services/`)
- `unicode_cache.py` — pre-computed unicode character mappings
- `sunlight_helper.py` — adaptive brightness via solar irradiance
- `add_to_startup.py` — OS autostart registration (see Key notes below)

## Key notes

- **Linux HID permissions**: `polyhost/device/99-hid.rules` must be installed as a udev rule for non-root HID access.
- **Venv**: always use `PolyKybdHost/.venv/bin/python` — system `python3` lacks numpy, PyQt5, and other runtime deps.
- **Test discovery**: test files follow `*_test.py` naming under `tests/` mirroring `polyhost/` structure. pytest is disabled in VS Code config; use `unittest`. New test packages require an `__init__.py`.
- **No CI**: no GitHub Actions workflows exist in this repo.
- **Single-key keymap write**: the firmware supports `ID_DYNAMIC_KEYMAP_SET_KEYCODE` (0x05) — payload is `[layer, row, col, keycode_hi, keycode_lo]`. No need to write a full layer; `PolyKybd.set_dynamic_keycode()` wraps this.
- **Autostart** (`polyhost/services/add_to_startup.py`): `setup_autostart_for_app()` registers the app to start at login (called from `main_app.py` unless `--portable`).
  - **Windows**: prefers a per-user, **non-elevated logon scheduled task** (`RunLevel Limited` / `LogonType Interactive`, via PowerShell `Register-ScheduledTask`) — needs no admin/UAC and starts earlier than the Startup folder, which Explorer throttles. The task launches the **proven venv-activating `.bat` wrapper** (`create_windows_bat_wrapper`); do **not** swap this for a direct `pythonw -m polyhost` call — running the venv interpreter without activation drops the `Scripts` dir from `PATH` and the app dies silently (regressed once, see git history). The `.bat` is run **windowless** through `wscript.exe` + a hidden-launch `.vbs` (`create_windows_hidden_vbs`, window style 0) so no console flashes. Falls back to a Startup-folder shortcut if task creation is refused (locked-down Task Scheduler). Gotchas learned the hard way: `New-ScheduledTaskAction -Argument ''` is rejected — only pass `-Argument` when non-empty; and f-strings with backslashes in the expression part break on Python < 3.12.
  - **Linux**: `.desktop` autostart entry; **macOS**: `launchd` plist.
  - `get_autostart_status()` reports which mechanism is in place (printed at startup); `remove_autostart()` tears all of them down. `--portable` removes any existing entry rather than just skipping registration.
- **Layout dialog** (`polyhost/gui/layout_dialog/`): fully implemented — layer switching re-renders all key labels from the cached buffer; clicking a key then selecting from the browser writes immediately to the device via `set_dynamic_keycode()` and keeps the local buffer in sync. `RenderableKey` carries `matrix_index` for row/col derivation.

## Future language candidates

The language menu in `polyhost/host.py` (`_LANG_REGION`) already covers all ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes, so adding a new language only requires firmware support — the host will automatically place it in the correct regional submenu.

Candidates shortlisted by user-base size and keyboard-layout distinctiveness:

### Oceania
| Code | Language / Country | Notes |
|------|--------------------|-------|
| `en-AU` | English / Australia | Largest tech market in Oceania; distinct locale (date format, spelling) |
| `en-NZ` | English / New Zealand | High tech adoption; ~5 M users |
| `tl-PH` | Filipino / Philippines | Largest Pacific-adjacent user base; geographically SE Asia but culturally Oceanian in feel — would land in **Asia** submenu via `PH` |
| `mi-NZ` | Māori / New Zealand | Official NZ language; Latin + macrons (ā ē ī ō ū) + okina; active digital revitalisation |
| `haw-US` | Hawaiian / United States | Polynesian; Latin + okina (ʻ) + kahakō macrons; note: `US` country code puts it in **Americas** — would need a custom code (e.g. `haw-HI`) to land in Oceania |
| `sm-WS` | Samoan / Samoa | Most widely spoken Polynesian language; large diaspora in NZ/AU; Latin with macrons |
| `fj-FJ` | Fijian / Fiji | Most developed Pacific island nation outside AU/NZ; Latin-based |

### Africa
| Code | Language / Country | Notes |
|------|--------------------|-------|
| `en-ZA` | English / South Africa | Largest tech ecosystem on the continent |
| `ar-EG` | Arabic / Egypt | ~90 M internet users; complements existing `ar-SA` with Egyptian locale |
| `sw-KE` | Swahili / Kenya | ~200 M speakers across East Africa; Kenya is the continent's leading tech hub; genuinely distinct from existing entries |
| `am-ET` | Amharic / Ethiopia | Unique Ge'ez (Ethiopic) script; ~120 M people; fast-growing tech sector |
| `yo-NG` | Yoruba / Nigeria | ~50 M speakers; Nigeria has Africa's largest developer community; Latin with tone diacritics |
| `af-ZA` | Afrikaans / South Africa | Germanic/Latin; well-established digital presence; distinct from `en-ZA` |
